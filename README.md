# Sorting-algorithms

## About

This program sorts the entered integer array with four different sorting algorithms and shows the time spent by each of them on this.

***

## Functionality

* First, the number of elements in the array is entered, and then the array itself. Both of these actions are accompanied by system prompts.

* In case of any error there will be shown a message "Error in input".

* Then there will be displayed results of sorting by 4 algorithms in form of:
    * Name of algorithm
    * Sorted array
    * Time spent on sorting

* Sorting algorithms used in the program:
    * Sorting by choice
    * Bubble sorting
    * Quick sorting
    * Sorting by heaps
